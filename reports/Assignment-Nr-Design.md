## Part 1 - Design for streaming analytics

*1. Select a dataset suitable for streaming analytics for a customer as a running example (thus the basic unit of the data should be a discrete record/event data). Explain the dataset and atleast two different analytics for the customer:*
   * *(i) a streaming analytics which analyzes streaming data from the customer (`customerstreamapp`) and*
   * *(ii) a batch analytics which analyzes historical results outputted by the streaming analytics. The explanation should be at a high level to allow us to understand the data and possible analytics so that, later on, you can implement and use them in answering other questions. (1 point)*

For this assignment, I decided to continue with the [Indoor Localization Dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/2671590)
